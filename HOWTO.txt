Code-only export (client + server). Heavy assets and build outputs were removed.

Client (Vite + React Router v7):
1) cd client
2) npm install
3) npm run dev

Server (Express):
1) cd server
2) npm install
3) npm start (or: node server.js)

Note: If your src imports large images from /public or local assets, you may need to restore those images.
